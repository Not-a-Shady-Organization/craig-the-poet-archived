# Craig, the Poet

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We also rely on `not-a-shady-organization/not-shady-utils`. Clone that repo and add it to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable as

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:../not-shady-utils

```

## Calling on Craig

```bash
python3 craig_the_poet.py [URL_TO_MISSED_CONNECTIONS_AD]
```
